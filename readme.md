# Digital Art Warmup Tool

This was the result of a particularly bad bout of insomnia from me. It was getting hard to tell if the lines and circles I was drawing were straight without guides, and the guides I had on hand were too consistent.

So I wrote this - _it is very much hacked together quickly_ - a tool to practice drawing some arbitrary lines and circles. Maybe ovals at some point, if I get to it. Probably won't for a bit.

## Contributing

This project is a piece of shit, but it's very useful to me at least. Maybe it is to you. I'll gladly accept pull requests.
